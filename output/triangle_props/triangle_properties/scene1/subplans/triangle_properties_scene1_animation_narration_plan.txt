[ANIMATION_STRATEGY]
1. **Pedagogical Animation Plan:**
    - **Parent VGroup Transitions:**
        • All elements (triangle, vertex labels, side labels, and angle arcs with labels) are grouped into a main VGroup called "triangle_group" to ensure uniform spatial spacing.
        • A subtle FadeIn transition (run_time=0.5 seconds) is applied to the entire "triangle_group" right after the triangle is created. This gradual reveal directs the learner’s focus from the overall shape to its individual components.
        • Pedagogical rationale: By grouping related elements, we help the viewer understand that the triangle and its labels are part of one coherent geometric object, reinforcing the concept that each side and angle is interdependent.
        
    - **Element Animations within VGroups and for Individual Mobjects:**
        • For the scene title, a Write animation (run_time=1 second) is used on a Tex object reading "Intro Triangles" positioned at the top center (using .to_edge(UP, buff=0.5)). This initial animation sets a clear, focused context while ensuring the text remains within the safe margins.
        • The central triangle is drawn using a Create animation (run_time=2 seconds) on a Polygon object defined by three vertices placed relative to the ORIGIN. The drawing is done with careful attention to ensuring that each vertex remains at least 0.5 units from the scene edge.
        • Each vertex label ("A", "B", "C") is animated using Write (run_time=0.7 seconds each) and is positioned using .next_to() with a minimum buff of 0.3 units from the corresponding vertex. The labels are placed in directions (for instance, UP+LEFT for "A", DOWN+RIGHT for "B", and UP+RIGHT for "C") to avoid overlap.
        • Side labels ("side AB", "side BC", "side CA") are placed at the midpoints of the corresponding sides using the .get_midpoint() method and then shifted outward using .next_to() with a buff of 0.3 units. Each side label is animated sequentially with Write (run_time=0.6 seconds each).
        • Optional angle arcs and labels (e.g., "∠A", "∠B", "∠C") are introduced with a Create animation (run_time=0.5 seconds for the arc) followed by a Write animation (run_time=0.6 seconds for the Tex label), placed near the vertices with .next_to() ensuring the safe area margin.
        • Pedagogical purpose: Each individual animation isolates a key feature of the triangle—a vertex, a side, or an angle. By animating them sequentially and with a controlled pacing, viewers are able to digest one piece of information at a time, building up an integrated understanding of the triangle’s geometry.

    - **Coordination Between VGroup Transitions and Individual Animations:**
        • Once the triangle has been drawn and the main "triangle_group" is established, the vertex labels animate one after another. A brief Wait(0.3 seconds) is inserted between each to give the viewer time to absorb each label.
        • After the vertices are labeled, a similar staged sequence is used for the side labels and angle elements with respective Wait(0.3 seconds) intervals.
        • Overall, these coordinated animations (using Succession for each label group and a final AnimationGroup for highlighting combined elements) ensure spatial coherence and maintain the minimum spacing of 0.3 units between every element.
        • Pedagogical explanation: This sequencing not only enhances clarity but also reinforces the concept that the triangle is composed of parts that together define its structure.

2. **Scene Flow - Pedagogical Pacing and Clarity:**
    - **Overall Animation Sequence, Spatial Progression for Learning:**
        • The scene begins with the scene title "Intro Triangles" appearing at the top center, setting the thematic context.
        • Next, the triangle is drawn centrally with a clear Create animation, ensuring that the shape is fully within the safe area margins (0.5 units from every edge), establishing the primary geometric object.
        • After the triangle appears, vertex labels ("A", "B", "C") are sequentially written at positions determined by their relative location, ensuring a clear separation (minimum 0.3 units) from the triangle’s vertices.
        • Following the vertices, side labels and optional angle representations are added at the midpoints and adjacent to the vertices, respectively, allowing learners to see the relationship between the abstract labels and the actual geometric sides and angles.
        • Pedagogical rationale: By progressing in clear, distinct steps—from the overall shape to its finer details—the animation builds a mental model of a triangle as a combination of line segments and angles, paving the way for later concepts (such as angle sums and area formulas).

    - **Transition Buffers for Pedagogical Pauses:**
        • A Wait(1 second) is inserted after the scene title to allow viewers to focus on the topic.
        • After creating the triangle, a Wait(0.5 seconds) provides time for the viewer to process the shape before its parts are labeled.
        • Brief Wait(0.3 seconds) pauses are added between labeling each vertex and each side/angle to give the viewer time to connect the animation with the geometric feature being discussed.
        • Pedagogical reasoning: These pauses ensure that viewers have time to internalize each piece of information rather than being overwhelmed, enhancing retention and understanding.

    - **Coordination of Animation Timing with Narration:**
        • The narration will reference the appearance of each element (title, triangle outline, vertex labels, side labels, and angle arcs) and pause momentarily in sync with the Wait() calls.
        • Clear auditory cues ("Notice how this vertex is labeled 'A'...", "Now, observe the midpoint of side AB") guide the viewer’s attention precisely as each object appears.
        • This synchronization maximizes engagement by aligning visual and auditory learning stimuli, reinforcing critical learning points exactly as they are introduced.

[NARRATION]
- **Pedagogical Narration Script:**

    "Welcome to Scene 1: Intro Triangles. In this segment, we will explore the basic structure of one of the simplest yet most important geometric figures—a triangle. 
    [Cue: As the title 'Intro Triangles' is written at the top of the screen, pause for 1 second.]
    
    "Notice the triangle appearing in the center of the screen. A triangle is defined as a closed three-sided polygon, meaning it has exactly three sides, three vertices, and three interior angles. 
    [Cue: As the triangle is drawn with a Create animation over 2 seconds, emphasize that every vertex is strategically placed within our safe area.]

    "Let’s focus on its three vertices. Each vertex – labeled 'A,' 'B,' and 'C' – represents a corner of the triangle. As each label appears one by one (with a pause of about 0.3 seconds between each), think of these points as the fundamental building blocks of the triangle's structure.
    [Cue: Synchronize with the Write animations for vertex labels, and allow brief pauses for each.]

    "Now, observe the labels along the sides. These indicate not just the edges but also help us reference the side lengths when we discuss measures and properties later. Each side label is carefully placed at the midpoint of the respective side, ensuring clear separation from the vertices.
    [Cue: As each side label 'side AB', 'side BC', and 'side CA' appears (each with a Write animation of 0.6 seconds), highlight the spatial balance with a slight pause.]

    "Additionally, we introduce angle indicators near each vertex. These arcs and angle labels, such as '∠A,' mark where the interior angles of the triangle appear. They are positioned with precision—at least 0.3 units away from other elements—to reinforce that even the angles have defined positions and relationships.
    [Cue: Sync the appearance of the angle arcs and labels with the corresponding Create and Write animations.]

    "By carefully constructing and labeling the triangle, we are building a strong foundation for understanding more complex properties later, such as the sum of interior angles and area calculations. 
    [Cue: A final Wait(1 second) allows viewers to consolidate the information before transitioning to the next segment.]
    
    "Now that we’ve clearly defined the triangle’s basic structure, let's move on to exploring how these parts interact and contribute to its overall geometric properties. Stay tuned as we dive deeper into triangle properties in the upcoming scenes."
    
- **Narration Sync - Pedagogical Alignment:**
    • The narration begins as soon as the title is written, ensuring the viewer's attention is immediately drawn to the core concept.
    • Each cue in the narration directly corresponds to the start or end of an animation (for example, the triangle drawing or vertex label appearance), so that viewers can match what they see with what they hear.
    • Pauses (implemented via Wait() calls) in both the narration and animation provide the necessary cognitive buffer, ensuring that learners have sufficient time to process each concept before moving on.
    • This synchronized approach maximizes engagement and optimizes the learning experience by strategically guiding the viewer’s focus to key elements right when they emerge on the screen.
