Error Type: Runtime Error
Error Location: In DummyVoiceover during the call to self.voiceover(text=...) in line 78 of triangle_properties_scene2_v3.py, and internally in manim_voiceover/voiceover_scene.py at line 69.
Root Cause: The DummyVoiceover class, used as a fallback when the voiceover file is missing, is missing the _wrap_generate_from_text method that the voiceover system expects to call.
Impact: Without this method, the voiceover functionality fails, causing an AttributeError which prevents the scene from rendering properly.
Solution:
[FIXES_REQUIRED]
- Fix 1: Implement the _wrap_generate_from_text method in the DummyVoiceover class.
  - Location: Within the DummyVoiceover class definition.
  - Change: Add a method _wrap_generate_from_text(self, text, **kwargs) that returns a dummy dictionary with the key "final_audio". This ensures that the voiceover system can call and retrieve the required structure.
- Fix 2: Ensure that DummyVoiceover remains compatible with the expected interface while preserving the rest of the functionality intact.
