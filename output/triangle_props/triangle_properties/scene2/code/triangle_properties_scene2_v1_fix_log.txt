Error Type: Runtime/ModuleNotFoundError
Error Location: File "triangle_properties_scene2_v0.py", around line 5 (the import statement "from src.utils.kokoro_voiceover import KokoroService")
Root Cause: The interpreter cannot find a module named "src" because the current PYTHONPATH does not include the directory where the "src" folder resides. This is often due to running the script from a directory that does not expose the folder structure as expected.
Impact: The scene fails to run because the custom voiceover service (KokoroService) is never imported; therefore, all voiceover functionality in the scene is affected.
Solution:
[FIXES_REQUIRED]
- Fix 1: Ensure the "src" folder is in the module search path. One common solution is to modify the sys.path at the beginning of the file so that the parent directory (which contains the "src" folder) is included.
  - Location: At the very beginning of the file (before any imports from "src")
  - Change: Insert code to modify sys.path by adding the parent directory. For example:
    import os
    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..")))
This change preserves the original intent (using the custom voiceover) while ensuring that the module "src" is accessible.

```python
import os
import sys
# Add the parent directory (which contains the 'src' folder) to the module search path.
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..")))
