[ANIMATION_STRATEGY]
1. **Pedagogical Animation Plan:**
    - Overall, the scene is divided into three sub-VGroups (LeftGroup for the acute triangle, CenterGroup for the right triangle, and RightGroup for the obtuse triangle) arranged horizontally. Each group contains a triangle, an angle marker, and an annotation. All groups are positioned using relative methods (.to_edge() and .next_to()) ensuring a 0.5 unit safe margin from scene edges and a 0.3 unit spacing between objects.
    
    - **Parent VGroup Transitions:**
        • The scene begins by creating a title VGroup ("Angle Variations") that is written at the top-center using Write() with a run_time of 1 second. This title is positioned with .to_edge(UP, buff=0.5) to emphasize the scene topic and guide viewer attention.
        • Next, three empty VGroups are instantiated and then populated with the triangle visuals. They are positioned in sequence: LeftGroup at the left safe margin, CenterGroup centered, and RightGroup at the right safe margin. Each is spaced apart by at least 0.3 units via .next_to() calls. This spatial organization immediately communicates to the learner that three distinct cases are being compared.
        • A brief Shift animation (or static positioning if preferred) is used when the groups are placed. This transition, although subtle, reinforces the separation between different triangle types and directs focus sequentially.
    
    - **Element Animations within VGroups:**
        • **Sub-scene A (Layout Establishment):**
            - The title text "Angle Variations" is animated with Write() over 1 second.
            - Each VGroup (LeftGroup, CenterGroup, RightGroup) is created empty initially; then a Wait(1) is inserted so the viewer has time to absorb the title and layout.
        • **Sub-scene B (Acute Triangle):**
            - The acute triangle is drawn using Create() over 1 second. Its vertices are arranged to ensure all angles are less than 90°.
            - A small Arc marker (simulating an acute angle indicator) is FadeIn()’ed near one vertex with a 1-second run_time and a buffer positioning using .next_to() with buff=0.3.
            - A Tex annotation "Acute Triangle" is written below the triangle with Write() (run_time=1).
            - The sequencing (Create → FadeIn for the arc → Write for the text) builds understanding step-by-step, emphasizing the specific angle properties at each vertex.
        • **Sub-scene C (Right Triangle):**
            - The right triangle is constructed with Create() over 1 second using explicit Polygon coordinates to ensure a 90° angle.
            - A small square (or Rectangle) marker is FadeIn() to highlight the right angle. It is positioned using .next_to() with a 0.3 unit buffer.
            - The Tex annotation "Right Triangle" is placed below the triangle using Write() (run_time=1).
            - This progression reinforces the concept of a defined right angle via visual contrast (square marker vs. arc markers).
        • **Sub-scene D (Obtuse Triangle):**
            - The obtuse triangle is drawn using Create() over 1 second. One vertex is deliberately set to exceed 90°.
            - An extended Arc with a larger sweep (e.g., 130° to 150°) is FadeIn() adjacent to the obtuse vertex, using .next_to() with a 0.3 unit buffer. This visually distinguishes it from the smaller acute indicators.
            - A Tex annotation "Obtuse Triangle" is written below the triangle using Write() (run_time=1).
            - Such an animated sequence reinforces the distinct geometric property of an obtuse angle.
    
    - **Synchronization and Sequencing:**
        • Each sub-scene is separated by Wait() commands (0.5 to 1 second) to allow learners time to process the information before moving to the next triangle type.
        • For the final summary overlay positioned at the bottom-center (using .to_edge(DOWN, buff=0.5)), a brief Write() animation (run_time=1) is used, followed by a Wait(1) for reflection.
        • The entire sequence of animations is synchronized with narration cues, meaning as each triangle and its markers animate, the lecturer highlights the relevant geometric principles. This synchronization ensures that visual information appears as soon as it is explained.

2. **Scene Flow - Pedagogical Pacing and Clarity:**
    - **Overall Animation Sequence & Spatial Progression:**
        • Start with the title "Angle Variations" at the top-center (run_time=1).
        • Introduce the three VGroups (LeftGroup, CenterGroup, RightGroup) arranged horizontally with ample spacing (minimum 0.3 units) and respecting the safe area (0.5 units from edges).
        • Animate the acute triangle (LeftGroup) first, then wait for 0.5 seconds. Next, animate the right triangle (CenterGroup) then pause, and finally, animate the obtuse triangle (RightGroup).
        • End with a consolidated summary overlay at the bottom center.
    - **Transition Buffers for Pedagogical Pauses:**
        • Insert a Wait(1) after the title to allow understanding of the scene context.
        • After each triangle and its annotation, a Wait(0.5) is inserted so viewers can absorb the transformation before the next triangle appears.
        • These pauses serve as “processing breaks” that make sure learners can correlate the verbal explanation with the visual animation.
    - **Coordination of Animation Timing with Narration:**
        • Each animation element (triangle drawing, marker appearance, text writing) begins immediately after its corresponding narration cue.
        • For example, as the narration mentions “the acute triangle has all angles less than 90°,” the corresponding triangle and its small arc are animated.
        • The timings (run_time values) and explicit Wait() commands ensure that the narration and animations are tightly coupled, drawing the learner’s attention to the specific visual reinforcement of the lesson.

[NARRATION]
- **Pedagogical Narration Script:**
    "Now, in Scene 3, we explore 'Angle Variations' by examining how triangles are classified by the measures of their interior angles. [At cue: Title appears]
    
    Let’s begin by observing our scene title at the top. This title sets the stage, much like a headline announcing the key idea: that triangles exhibit distinct angle properties. 
    
    [Cue: LeftGroup animation begins]
    In the left section, we have an Acute Triangle. Notice how each interior angle is less than 90 degrees. Here, I’ve drawn a small arc near one vertex as a visual cue to highlight its acute nature. Imagine a slice of pizza – all the slices are sharp and narrow. This illustration reinforces that in an acute triangle, none of the angles reach a right angle.
    
    [Wait ~0.5 seconds]
    Moving to the center, we now see a Right Triangle. The careful construction of this triangle ensures that one of its angles measures exactly 90 degrees, indicated by the square marker. Think of it as the corner of a book, a perfect right angle that is critical in many geometric constructions. This marker not only distinguishes the right angle but also emphasizes precision in geometry.
    
    [Wait ~0.5 seconds]
    Finally, in the right section, observe the Obtuse Triangle. In this triangle, one angle is deliberately drawn larger than 90 degrees – an obtuse angle. The extended arc around this vertex visually demonstrates the concept of an angle being more open. Consider this the equivalent of a wide-open door, visually reinforcing the idea that not all triangles have sharp corners; some spread out more.
    
    [Cue: Summary overlay appears at bottom]
    To summarize, these three examples illustrate how triangle classifications depend on the nature of their interior angles. Remember, acute triangles have all angles below 90 degrees, right triangles contain one 90-degree angle, and obtuse triangles feature an angle greater than 90 degrees. Building on what we’ve learned so far, this understanding forms a foundation for more advanced geometric concepts.
    
    As we transition, reflect on these visual markers – the small arcs and the square – which are key to quickly identifying triangle types. Let’s now move forward with this framework in mind."
    
- **Narration Sync - Pedagogical Alignment:**
    • The narration begins with the title and is synchronized to the Write() animation of the "Angle Variations" title (run_time=1), ensuring that viewers immediately connect the words with the visual.
    • As the narrator describes the acute triangle, the explanation coincides with the Create() and FadeIn() animations in the LeftGroup. The wait of 0.5 seconds after the acute triangle animation gives the learner time to process the visual before moving on.
    • Similarly, when moving to the right triangle, the narration “exactly 90 degrees” matches with the appearance of the square marker and the triangle’s drawing in the CenterGroup. The synchronization of spoken explanation with visual marker appearance reinforces correct understanding.
    • Finally, the narrator’s explanation of the obtuse triangle is aligned with its extended arc animation. A subsequent wait ensures that the learners have ample time to capture the differences among the types.
    • Overall, narrational pauses and explicit cues are embedded in timed waits (1 second after the title, 0.5 seconds after each triangle) to maximize the connection between spoken words and dynamic visuals, ensuring a robust, pedagogically sound learning experience.
